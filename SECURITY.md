# Security Policy

Please responsibly disclose any security issues you find in the library.

If you believe that there is a serious security issue that may affect sites using Iron Auth, we ask that you get in touch directly via email at james@eli.cx.

Please do not open a public issue or pull request so as to not publicize the vulnerability. We will respond as quickly as possible.

Acknowledgement for identifying a security issue will be given on the documentation site.
